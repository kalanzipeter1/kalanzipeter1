# Hello, I'm Peter Kalanzi ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer on a journey to explore the world of programming. My journey began with C from where I'll expand my horizons and explore various programming languages and technologies.

## Projects

### C Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on using the C programming language:

1. **Simple Calculator Program**
   - Link: https://github.com/kalanzipeter1/kalanzipeter1/tree/main/Simple_calculator.
   - Description: This is a simple calaculator program with only the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations written in C. It also detects an invalid operation and prints an error message. 
     

I'm actively working on other projects while exploring other programming languages. Stay tuned for more exciting projects!
